Summary:

There are two fundamental techniques for encrypting data
1.) Symmetric cryptography:
One common key is used for encrypting the plain text and decrypting the cipher text.
Examples - DES, 3DES, Blowfish and AES

2.) Asymmetric cryptography:
Public key is used to encrypt the plain text and Private key is used to decrypt the cipher text.
Examples - RSA and ELGAMAL Schema

Parameters used to evaluate a algortithim:
1.) Encryption time: 
Time measured in milliseconds taken to encrypt plain text.
Good algorithims have low encryption time.

2.) Decryption time:
Time measured in milliseconds taken to retrieve the plain text from the cipher text.
Good algorithims have low decryption time.

3.) Memory Usage:
Low memory usage is desirable to affect the system less.

4.) Throughput:
Attained by dividing the encoded block size by entire encode time.
Power consumption decreases if throughput increases.

Various encryption algorithims:

1.) DES (Data Encryption Standard):
It is a Symmetric key algorithim. It follows the Feistel Cipher Structure which is a block cipher.
Block size = 64 bits
Key size = 48 bits

Working:
There are 16 rounds of the fiestel cipher with each round having a different key.
Round Working:
    The plaintext is divided into two equal halves L0(32 bit) R0(32 bit).
    R0 is passed through a round function whose output will be XOR with L0 and the output will be R1.
    L1 is R0.
Round function Working:
    The right half(32 bit) is passed through an expansion box to convert it into 48 bit as the key
    is 48 bit.
    The key and the expanded right half is XOR and then passed onto a substituition box to convert
    it back into 32 bit.
Key:
    Originally a 56 bit cipher key is used which is passed through a round key generator which generates
    a different 48 bit key for every round.
Modes of Operation:
    Electronic Codebook
    Cipher Block Chaining
    Cipher feedback block
    Output feedback
    Counter method
Problems:
    56-bit key is too short

2.) 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard):
It improves on the DES in ways such as
    i.) DES algorihtim is applied three times per round
    ii.) Key length is 112 or 168 bit.
    iii.) Number of rounds is 48
Problem:
    This encryption took a lot of time not making it viable for practical use.

3.) Blowfish:
It follows the fiestel structure with block size 64 bits. Key is anwhere between 32 to 448 bits but default is 128 bit.
Has 16 rounds.
Characteristics:
    Fast and can run on less memory.
    Key is divided into 18 subkeys each subkey being 32 bits. Stored in P array.
    Key is also divided 4 S-boxes (128 bit key) each S-box being 32 bit.
    S-boxes take 8 bits as input and produces a 32 bit output.
Working:
    Pn = Pn XOR (nth 32 bit of K array)
    Plaintext is divided into 2 equal halves L0(32 bit) and R0(32 bit)
    L0 XOR P1 will be R1 and passed onto a round function whose output
    will be XOR with R0 and will become L1.
Round Function:
    K(31-24)    K(23-16)    K(15-8)    K(7-0) 
       |           |           |         |
       |           |           |         |
      S-box 1     S-box 2     S-box 3   S-box 4  
         ----XOR----           |         |
              |                |         |
              --------XOR-------         |
                       |                 |
                       ---------XOR-------
                                 |
                                 O/p
4.) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
It is a symmetric block cipher where block size is 128 bits. and Key size can be 128, 192 or 256 bits.
Features:
    Use Substitution and Permutation called SP networks.
    A single key is expanded to be used in multiple rounds.
    AES performs on byte data instead of bit data.
    No of rounds is dependent on key lenght.
    128 bit key --> 10 rounds
    192 bit key --> 12 rounds
    256 bit key --> 14 rounds
    Everything is stored in a 4x4 matrix format called state array.
    Each cell corresponds to one byte. 4 bytes = 1 words so each state array has 4 words.
    Each round takes a state array as input and produces a similar output.
    Key is expanded n + 1 times with n rounds.

Round working:
    Plaintext XOR K0 --> SubBytes --> ShiftRows --> Mix columns --> round key XOR O/p Mix columns
                        |     Substitution     |   |Permutation|         
SubBytes:
    Each byte is converted to hexadecimal with 2 equal parts first part being row and second column,
    thus resulting in a 16x16 matrix which is then passed to S-box which gives final state array.

ShiftRows:
    Used to increase complexity of the algorithim. Shift right.
    1   2   3   4  ------>  1   2   3   4 
    5   6   7   8           6   7   8   5
    9   10  11  12          11  12  9   10
    13  14  15  16          16  13  14  15

MixColumns:
    Multiply each column of the state array with a constant matrix. Resultant matrix will form the
    new column.

Vulnerabilities:
RSA - Forced and Oracle attack
DES - Brute Forced, Linear and differential, Cryptanalysis attack
AES - Brute Force Attack
3DES - Meet-in-the-middle-attack
Blowfish - Birthday Attack
ECC - Brute Force Attack

AES - Low, Excellent Security
3DES - Low, Excellent Security
Blowfish - Low, Least Secured
