	char api_buf[FLAG_BUFFER];
	FILE *f = fopen("api","r");
	if (!f) {
		printf("Flag file not found. Contact an admin.\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	fgets(api_buf, FLAG_BUFFER, f);

    Above code snippet tells us flag is opened and stored on the stack 

    scanf("%300s", user_buf);
    printf(user_buf);

    This is an example of format string vulnerability as there are no format specifiers while printing.
    So we give inputs as %x%x%x.......which gives hex values insides the satck. After converting it to
    ascii we can find out ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n841645eb} this is in reverse so we will swap
