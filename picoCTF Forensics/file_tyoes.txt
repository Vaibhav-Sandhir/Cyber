After using hexedit on the Flag file you can see it is not a pdf file it is a shell script written with sharutils.
So execute the shell script
CMD: sh Flag.pdf

Then files are compressed using different types the commands for the following are:
lzma flag 
lunzip flag
gzip -d flag.gz 
And LZO file I could not find command so manually extract
