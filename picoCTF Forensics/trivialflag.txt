Open the file in wireshark and filter all the data packets according to TFTP.
We can see that there are many files in this protocol so we will go to
File -> Export Objects -> TFTP
Form those files

decode instruction.txt using rot 13
echo 'GSGCQBRFAGRAPELCGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA'
| rot13
It gives TFTP Does not encrypt our traffic so we must disguise our flag transfer. Figure out a way to hide the flag and
I will check back for the plan

This is a hint to look at the plan.txt
echo 'VHFRQGURCEBTENZNAQUVQVGJVGU-QHRQVYVTRAPR.PURPXBHGGURCUBGBF' | rot13
It gives I used the program and hid it with - due diligence. check out the photos

In the program.deb file we can see a steghide which can be used for extracting
Steghide is steganography program which hides bits of a data file in some of the least significant bits of another
file in such a way that the existence of the data file is not visible and cannot be proven.
So we will extract from the images using steghide

cmd: steghide extract -sf picture1.bmp  // sf is for source file
password will be DUEDILIGENCE
Ultimately flag will be in picture3.bmp
