After finding out that the image is an BMP file. Compare it with a normal BMP file which can be opened and change
the first row of the tunnelvision according to the normal file. After that the image can be opened but not all of it is 
visible so to increase the height change the value in 2nd row 8th column

cmd: exiftool tunn3l_v1s10n  // To find out the format of the image
     hexedit tunn3l_v1s10n    // Hexeditor
