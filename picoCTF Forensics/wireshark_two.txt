8.8.8.8 is Google's adress so click on Source which will sort and we can look at the adress
18.217.1.57 and then we can see it has queries with == therefore base 64 decoding

CMD: tshark -r shark2.pcapng -T fields -e dns.qry.name -Y "dns.qry.name != ' ' && ip.dst == 18.217.1.57" | grep -oE "^[^.]*" | uniq | base64 -d

Second COndition is for the queries coming specifically from 18.217.1.57
-o of grep only returns the substring which was searched for
^[^.]*" returns all the strings till the . appears 0 or many times beacuse of *
